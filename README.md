Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software engineering is a discipline that applies engineering processes to the design and development of software.
- It is important because it provides a solid foundation for developing software that is scalable and reliable.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-The NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968: 
This was the birth of software engineering, with the term being used for the first time in this German conference. 
Software engineering became recognized as a distinct field of study in response to the lack of adequate systems to manage the growing complexity of software.

-The introduction of structural programming in the 1970's:
Edsger W. Dijkstra's published structured programming to solve complexities in code.
This approach introduced control structures to programming, improving the readability of code.

-The introduction of agile methodologies in 2001
The Agile Manifesto was published by a group of like-minded software developers.
This revolutionized software development by promoting compounding development and flexible responses to changes in code.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-Planning: The scope and objectives of the project are defined. 
-Requirements analysis: The various stakeholders are involved in collecting and documenting the detailed requirements of the software.
-Design: The architecture and fine print details of the software are designed.
-Coding: Based on the design, the code for the software is written.
-Testing: Here the software is tested rigorously to try and identify any issues and/or defects.
-Deployment: The software is installed in the production environment.
-Maintenance: This is done by running updates and fixing bugs based on user feedback.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-Waterfall methodology:
This is a more rigid, structured, and linear methodology in software development. This means that the steps are ordered and one needs to complete one phase before moving to the next. 
It is clear and predictable but on the other hand it is rigid and lacks customer feedback.
This is appropriate for making software that requires stringent restrictions for instance government-oriented software.

-Agile methodologies:
This approach is more relaxed, emphasizing more on feedback and collaboration to develop software. This allows the developer to add functionalities in short increments.
It is flexible and allows for early delivery, but on the other hand it is less predictable and depends on collaboration.
It is appropriate for instances such as developing a new customer-oriented mobile app.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-Software developer: Responsible for designing, developing, debugging, and reviewing software.
-Quality assurance engineer: Responsible for planning and executing tests, improving quality of software, and reporting bugs.
-Project manager: Responsible for planning a project, resource and risk management as well as stakeholder engagement. 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-Intergrated Development Environments provide a centralized workspace where productivity is enhanced. 
An example is Visual Studio Code.

-Version Control Systems: They help keep track of changes made to the codebase over time. They also enhance collaboration and acts as backup for code recovery.
An example is Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Requirement changes: Software requirements may change in the process of building software. The best way to tackle this is by adapting agile methodologies in developing that software.
-Debugging and testing: It is time consuming especially with large codebases. To fix this, I'd automate testing and use debugging tools.
-Managing complexity: As the codebase grows, things become more complex. This can be fixed by doing periodic code reviews to identify and deal with code complexities early. 
-Staying up to date with technology: Staying up to date with new tools and technologies in programming can be a challenge. To fix this, One should invest in continuous learning as well as staying in a community where you can update each other.
-Speed vs quality: Rushing to meet deadlines might lead to bad quality software. This can be fixed by setting realistic deadlines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit testing: This is the testing of individual components of codeIts crucial in helping in the early detection of bugs in the code as well as checking the reliability of the code. 
-Intergation testing: This focuses on testing the interaction between different units of code. It is important for detecting interface issues.
-System testing: This is done by testing the complete software system to verify that it meets the requirements. This assesses the performance and reliability of the software system. 
-Acceptance testing: This is performed by users and stakeholders. It is important to ensure user satisfaction as well as confirming the business requirements. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-This is the process of designing AI prompts to achieve a clear and desired result.
-Its impimportant when it comes to ensuring an effective interaction with the AI models available. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-Tell me about climate change
Improvement: Explain the impact of climate change on coastal cities and provide examples of cities that might get affected.
